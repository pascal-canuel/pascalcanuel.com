# Hi there :fire:

My name is Pascal and welcome to my blog. I make stuff. 

It includes:

- **5 duotone themes**, depending on your preferences (orange, red, blue, green, pink)
- [**Fira Code**](https://github.com/pascal-canuel/resume/blob/master/resume.pdf) 
as default monospaced font. It's gorgeous!
- **realy nice, custom duotone** syntax highlighting based on [**PrismJS**](https://prismjs.com)
- mobile friendly layout

So, there you have it... enjoy!
